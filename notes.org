* Problem:
  Macros expand to symbols which refer to objects in the expansion
  environment, not the module they come in.  This is problematic for
  macros which want to capture.  Indeed, there is no way they can
  effectively do so without, perhaps, expanding to a require form
  which evaluates the body of the expansion in the context of the
  original module.  Even this is not satisfactory.
